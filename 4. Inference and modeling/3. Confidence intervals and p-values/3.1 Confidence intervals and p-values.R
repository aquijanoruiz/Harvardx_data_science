mean(inside) #in 95% of the cases p will be between the confidence interval

#-----------------------The correct language---------------------------------------------

#It is important to remember that it is the intervals that are at random, not p.
#So the 95% relates to the probability that the random interval falls on top of p.
#Saying that p has a 95% chance of being between this and that is technically an incorrect statement
#because p is not random.

#spread is 2*SE[X_hat]

#confidence interval of the spread
#This confidence interval is zero. An interval that does not include 0, an interval that
#makes a call of who's going to win. The fact that our interval includes 0, it does not
#mean that this election is close. It only means that we have a small sample size.
#In the context of polls, power can be thought of as the probability of detecting a spread 
#different from 0.

#--------------------------------------p values---------------------------------------------
#null hypothesis: The null hypothesis is the skeptic's hypothesis: the spread is 0.
#is p=0.48, the spread is 2*p-1= 0.04
#p value: how likely is it to see a value this large (0.04) when the null hypothesis is true?

N<- 100
z<- sqrt(N)*0.02/0.5
p_value<- 1-(pnorm(z) - pnorm(-z)) #In this case, there's actually a large chance of seeing 52 blue beads or more
#under the null hypothesis that there is the same amount of blue beads as red beads.
#In Spanish: Hay una probabilidad de 68% de ver 52 pelotitas o mÃ¡s incluso habiendo la misma cantidad de pelotitas con una muestra de 100

#If a 95% confidence interval of the spread does not include 0, we can do a little bit of math to see that this implies 
#that the p-value must be smaller than 1 minus 95%, or 0.05.
