#In many cases, we do not observe data for the entire population of interest but rather for a random sample. As
#with the average and standard deviation, the sample correlation is the most commonly used estimate of the population correlation.

#letâ€™s assume that the 179 pairs of fathers and sons is our entire population. A less fortunate geneticist 
#can only afford measurements from a random sample of 25 pairs. The sample correlation can be computed with:

#-------------------------------getting a sample using sample() and sample_n()-----------------------
R <- sample(galton_heights$father,size=25,replace=TRUE) #to get a sample from one variable
R <- sample_n(galton_heights,size=25,replace=TRUE) #to get a sample from the whole data frame
R %>% summarise(r=cor(father,son)) %>% pull(r) 

#R is a random variable. We can run a Monte Carlo simulation to see its distribution:

B<- 10000
N<- 25
R<- replicate(B, {
  sample_n(galton_heights,size=25,replace=TRUE) %>%
    summarize(r=cor(father,son)) %>%
    pull(r)
})

qplot(R,geom="histogram",binwidth=0.05,color=I("black")) 
mean(R) #the mean of the correlation is close to 0.5
sd(R) #the standard error is very high due to the range of values r can take

#In our example, N = 25 does not seem to be large enough to make the approximation a good one.
